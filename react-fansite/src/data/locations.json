It is an underground region, with pools of lava and burning rock contrasting with the dark stone roof and the water on its cavernous floor, leading out to the sea. Also in this area is a barrier that players defend with cannons and ballistae, and a passage created by Zorah Magdaros, which leads to the Elder's Recess. It is similar to the Great Ravine, in the respect that only Zorah Magdaros is fought here.",

Your headquarters in Monster Hunter: World, Astera will be where you do everything from accepting quests, to crafting armor, to getting drunk with your friends in the gathering hub.",
            "about": "With the Guild at it's core, the Research Commission was formed in order to solve the mystery of the Elder Crossings. The base of their research activities is here in Astera It has been forty years since the First Fleet arrived and established this as a major stronghold, which was built by the hands, skills, efforts, and labor of many people. The First Fleet was deployed in pursuit of Kushala Daora. During a storm, the crew had a chance encounter with a mysterious Elder Dragon. The ship was split and tossed on top of a cliff, but it still eventually became a foothold for research projects. What's more, the waterfall flowing right below it turned out to be a stroke of good luck for the First Fleet. The First Fleet found it difficult to secure enough resources to upgrade their base at first and expanded the base by recycling their ship. They had no choice but to wait for further deployments to do any full-scale work, however, so they poured their efforts into reinforcing the ship atop the cliff.",
            "description": "Astera is built primarily out of wood, some taken from the very ships that brought the Research Commission to the New World. It sits below a waterfall between the Ancient Forest and Wildspire Waste. Astera is more of a base than a village, built to support the Hunters and researchers as they explore the New World and its ecology. It is built in three primary tiers. Winding stairs and a waterwheel-powered series of chain pulleys serve to move people and supplies from one tier to the other quickly. The Tradeyard is the ground floor, containing docks, supply caches, research 'offices'(really more of a massive pile of books), a meeting area, and an Ancient Tree. Some of the former ships also serve as bunks for hunters new to the area. The second tier contains the Workshop, where weapons and equipment are developed, and the Canteen, which serves food. Lodging for veteran New World hunters can also be found here, as can a training area.",
